# Coordinator plan amendments

## A09 — F00 Config composition owner path

- **Status:** independently reviewed and accepted by `/root/a09_reviewer`; product implementation may proceed after the amended integration commit is recorded.
- **Trigger:** F00 source tracing showed that the top-level `Config` fields and `impl Default for Config` are defined in `crates/ferric-browser-config/src/runtime_config.rs`; F00's original five-path allowlist could not add the required defaulted `[performance]` and `[passkeys]` sections or wire the existing tabs/hyprland fields.
- **Change:** add `runtime_config.rs` to F00 `allowed_paths`, `read_anchors`, and the slice's exact path list. F00 now allows 6 product files, below the 8-file limit. Add F00 to the existing source-map path record.
- **Evidence:** current `Config` at `runtime_config.rs:20` and `impl Default for Config` at `:82`; this same file is already an F01 anchor.
- **Dependency/lock effect:** no graph or lock changes. F01 already depends on F00, so its later access to `runtime_config.rs` remains serial. F00 retains its `config-model` lock.
- **Test effect:** T007–T009 and the existing focused `cargo test -p ferric-browser-config --locked` gate remain unchanged. No behavior/default/security requirement is weakened.
